In this post I'll share my hands-on experience with Cursor and share some insights from their documentation that might change how you work.

## My Experience

I was able to turn a dream project I've been putting off for 2 years around in less than 24 hrs!

While Cursor initially felt similar to GitHub Copilot, something about it stood out enough to convince me there's some unique things happening.

Would I purchase a year subscription? Absolutely. I wouldn't have said about GitHub Copilot just a few months ago.

## Usage Economics

In just 4-5 hours of work, I consumed 117/150 premium model requests — a staggering 24% of the monthly Pro plan allocation (500 requests/month). **This surprised me.**

I kept “auto-select” enabled all the time (Cursor does this to help you select the best premium model by detecting degraded output performance).

When you exhaust your monthly quota, Cursor moves you to a "slow pool" rather than cutting you off completely ([docs](https://docs.cursor.com/account/plans-and-usage)). Worth noting if you keep "auto-select" on at all times.

## The Documentation

### Project Rules (.mdc)

Rules let you hard-code AI behaviors when:
- Encoding domain-specific knowledge
- Automating repetitive workflows
- Standardizing architecture decisions

Access them by typing `/Generate Cursor Rules` in chat. Perfect for stable patterns you frequently reference.

### Agent Modes

There are three working modes. Agent Mode (default) will automatically search the web when needed. It essentially employs the `@Web` capability behind the scenes to get up-to-date information (coding discussiong, etc).

### AI Commit Messages

Cursor analyzes both current changes and previous commits to generate contextually appropriate messages. Since this counts against your monthly quota, use this feature strategically.

### Notepads (Beta)

I feel like the idea here is to extend linting configs further.

Notepads extend beyond `.cursorrules` to define:
- Reusable code patterns
- Project scaffolding rules
- Team consistency standards
- Development guidelines

Think of them as living documentation specifically designed to guide Cursor's outputs.

## Questions for Further Exploration

1. **Rule Balance**: Can too many rules reduce flexibility? Humans also maintain them, so keep it modular.
2. **Mode Management**: When is toggling between Ask/Edit/Agent modes worth the token savings?
3. **Optimization Strategy**: What's the right balance of features for maximum ROI?

The key seems to be developing a mental model of which features deliver the most value for your specific workflow — then testing.
