Let's get started.

### Project Rules

You can run `/Generate Cursor Rules` from the chat window. I'd be careful and not use this for things that change often.

Rules are written in .mdc and are helpful when:

* Encoding domain-specific knowledge about your codebase
* Automating project-specific workflows or templates
* Standardizing style or architecture decisions

In short, use it to hard-code LLM behavior:

> This is very useful when youâ€™ve had a conversation where many decisions were made about how the agent should behave. Simply generate the rule and reuse it in the future.

Also, you should use rules if you're repeating yourself in the chat prompts. So perhaps wait for that to happen.

Check out [Rules Examples](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules#examples) for more.

### Ask, Edit, Agent Modes

It's important to start by asking why is Agent Mode the default?

When using Agent mode, Cursor will automatically search the web when it needs up-to-date information or additional context. The alternative here would be to use the `@Web` symbol while chatting to tell Cursor to scrape multiple websites to find the best/more recent answers/discussions. In other words, Agent mode uses `@Web` under the hood, if it has to.

Other questions on my mind is often should I toggle between these modes?

### .cursorignore

Cursor already reads from `.gitignore`. Having an `.cursorignore` acts as a way to further restrict things.

### AI Commit Messages

The docs specifically mention that **"Cursor will analyze both your current changes and previous commit messages to generate a contextually appropriate message"**. So features like [AI Commit Messages](https://docs.cursor.com/more/ai-commit-message) count against the monthly quota.

Good commit messages tend to be a favorite thing of mine to write manually. It's a way to reflect and explain what was done in simple terms. As well as document it for others. The Cursor monthly quota can be used up quickly, so this is a cool feature that I'd be careful not to over-utilize.

A related question to be explored further:

What are some good ways not to under-utilize or over-utilize Cursor's Cursor functionalities? What's the right balance here? I feel like the answer has to do with building up a mental model of the features and their ROI for you. So test, test, test.

### Beta features

What Cursor featues are in beta? As of this writing, Notepads is one. But I have a hunch that this will be refactored, if you will, into another feature set.

## Notepads (beta)

Notepads allow you to go beyond `.cursorrules`. They can be referenced using the `@` syntax and are used as "templates" for development scenarios. It is for "sharing context between composers and chat", but apparently "composers" were renamed to "Chat", so [this part of the Notepads doc](https://docs.cursor.com/beta/notepads) may need updating.

According to the doc, Notepads helps define boilerplates (ie. code patterns, scaffolding rules, maintaining consistency across team, frontend/backend specs, data model specs, etc).

It sounds like like Notepads is something important to dig in deeper. It goes even beyond boilerplate generation or architecture documentation, but defining dev guidelines as well. Each of these are their own topics.

What should I write in Notepads? They mention it should be "documentation that needs to be referenced frequently". So what is the difference between Notepad rules and README.md? Sounds like Notepad helps give the AI context.
